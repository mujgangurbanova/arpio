      <h6>How Arpio Works</h6>
      <h2>Cross-Region & Cross-Account Recovery</h2>
      <p>
        Arpio curates an exact replica of your entire AWS environment –
        including data & infrastructure – enabling rapid failover that
        eliminates downtime.

      <h3 class="steps">5 Steps to Using Arpio</h3>
      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-number">1</div>
        <div class="item-content">
          <h4>Connect Arpio to your AWS environment</h4>
          <p>
            Arpio orchestrates cross-region and cross-account recovery within
            your AWS environment. To get started, we’ll generate a
            CloudFormation template that you’ll install to grant us minimal
            access.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Is this secure?</strong>
            <br />
            Yes. We can’t access your data, share your data externally, or do
            destructive things in your production environment. Our access allows
            us to survey your infrastructure, instruct AWS to copy your data to
            your recovery environment, and re-create everything as necessary.
            Your environment is safe because we’ve engineered Arpio to not need
            unsafe access.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-number">2</div>
        <div class="item-content">
          <h4>Select resources to protect</h4>
          <p>
            Once connected, Arpio presents a list of resources within your
            production environment. Your last task is to select resources that
            are important for your workload.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll only need to specify a couple of top-level resources. Arpio
            understands AWS dependencies, and we’ll find the rest for you. For
            example, point us at a load balancer and we’ll find the servers,
            subnets, SSL cert, security groups, and everything else needed to
            protect that entire workload.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Which AWS resource types does Arpio support?</strong>
            <br />
            Arpio works today with resources from EC2, EBS, RDS, ECS, ECR, ELB,
            VPC, IAM, ACM, Autoscaling, Cognito, ElastiCache, Elastic Beanstalk,
            and CloudWatch. We’re launching EFS and EKS next. If we don’t yet
            support your workload, let us know and we can make it a priority.
          </p>

      <div class="item">
        <div class="item-number">3</div>
        <div class="item-content">
          <h4>Arpio starts to replicate your environment</h4>
          <p>
            At this point, Arpio takes over and captures your first “recovery
            point.” A recovery point is a snapshot of your entire environment
            (infrastructure & data). Arpio copies the recovery point directly to
            your recovery environment. Data never leaves your accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the recovery point is copied, Arpio will create the no-cost AWS
            resources immediately. Resources that cost money won’t get created
            until you need them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Where is my data stored? </strong>
            <br />
            Your data is stored in your recovery account in the recovery region.
            For most services, we use the native cold-storage provided by the
            service. For example, EBS data is stored as EBS snapshots where it
            can be quickly recovered when you need it.
          </p>

        <div class="item-content">
          <h4>Run a test</h4>
          <p>
            Once your first recovery point is created, it’s time to run a test.
            Simply click “test” in the Arpio UI to bring up your entire recovery
            environment as quickly as AWS can launch your servers. When you’ve
            validated that’s it working, another button quickly tears it down so
            you won’t have to pay for it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Will my application work?</strong>
            <br />
            Most applications work on first launch, but sometimes a little
            troubleshooting may be required. Arpio does a pretty great job of
            creating an identical environment, reconnecting all infrastructure
            and preserving endpoints like IP addresses. Arpio also creates DNS
            aliases for RDS databases and ElastiCache nodes so your database
            connection details are still valid in your recovery environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Will this impact my production workload?</strong>
            <br />
            No. Your real users will continue hitting your production
            environment at this time. Arpio is just spinning up a replica for
            you to test.
          </p>

        <div class="item-content">
          <h4>Failover when needed</h4>
          <p>
            When you need it, Arpio is standing by to restore your service. One
            click in the Arpio UI will bring up your entire recovery environment
            in minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>If my region is down, will Arpio still work?</strong>
            <br />
            Yes. Arpio runs redundantly across 3 AWS regions, and we don’t
            protect your production environment from your production region.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Does Arpio update my DNS records?</strong>
            <br />
            The last step of any failover is to update DNS to point at the
            recovered environment. We leave that step to you so that you can
            validate it’s working before moving traffic over. But we expose
            every new load balancer endpoint, elastic IP, and public server
            address in our UI so those details are convenient.
